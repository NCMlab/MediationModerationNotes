# Flexible Modeling of Mediation

Created: 01-07-2022 16:28

The PROCESS model of Hayes defines a set of models. This is a very comprehensive set of possibilities; however, it is better to have a flexible approach.

In order to have flexible modeling there needs to be three user defined matrices:
1. [[The direct effects matrix]]
2. [[The interaction terms]]
3. [[The path matrix]]

 [[Using the flexible modeling approach]]

[[Defing data for mediation and moderation]]

The use of a flexible modeling apporach, may also be used for [[Flexible mediation data simulation|simulation]] of data as well. Little is known about the statistical power of complicated mediation or moderation models. Therefore, simulation studies are very important. Simulated data can be create by specifying the direct, interaction, and path matrices with values other than one. This would specify the weights in teh simulations. There would also need to be the specification of variance terms.
