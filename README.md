# My Notes 
Permanent Note
Created: 01-20-2022 11:10

I use the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) approach to note taking with a digital implementaton using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Some notes, I would like to share with students that I am working with. For that I have taken one folder in my Slipbox (collection of notes) and made a github repository of it. I then use the package [Neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron) to generate the HTML of the Markdown notes.

The result is the collection of pages you are seeing in this repository found here: (https://ncmlab.github.io/MediationModerationNotes/)
