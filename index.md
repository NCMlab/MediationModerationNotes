1. [[Cognitive Reserve]] can only be identified through some factor moderating the effect of age or pathology on cognition.
2. The effects of age on cognition are mediated through [[Age related diseases]].
3. Mediation models range from the simple [[Three Variable Mediation Model]] to more sophisticated parallel and serial mediation models.
4. [[Parallel mediation]]
5. [[Serial Mediation]]
6. [[Simple Moderation]]
7. [[Flexible modeling of Mediation]]
8. [[Mediation and Moderation for Brain Imaging]]
9. [[Library of Mediation-Moderation Models]]
10. 


## Subproject list
- Decide on [[Process Model Setup File|setup file format]], specifically what is needed.
	- This is where the user writes out the direct, indirect, path matrics as seen here [[Flexible modeling of Mediation]]
- Read setup file
- [[Render Mediation-Moderation Setup File]]
- Have user choose data and assign to design matrix
- Create equations using the data/variables as defined in the setup file
- Process data/equations
- Create path values as defined in the setup file, based on results
- Run bootstrapping on all parameters
- Calculate confidence intervals on bootstrap results
- Create a results summary page
- Create a library of setup files of the most common designs.
